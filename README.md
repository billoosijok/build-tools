This repository has been emptied to make place for a completely new build of the SproutCore Nodejs Buildtools.
If you are searching for the last version of garcon, please check https://github.com/mauritslamers/build-tools-1

This is the first architectural layout and other bits and pieces for the new SproutCore Buildtools.
At the moment most things are in flux, so these buildtools are not useable.

A basic autodetection system of apps is in place and can be tested.
This system can be installed by cloning this repo locally, run npm install in the root of the buildtools repo.
The system can be run by going to a project folder and calling path/to/buildtools/bin/sproutcore.
